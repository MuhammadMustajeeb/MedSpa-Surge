      question: "What if I don't like the redesign?",
      answer: "You don't pay until you're completely satisfied. We'll work with you through unlimited revisions during the 14-day period to ensure your website exceeds your expectations. If you're still not happy, you don't pay a dime."
    },
    {
      question: "How fast is delivery?",
      answer: "14 days, guaranteed. We've streamlined our process to deliver high-quality websites fast. You'll see progress updates every 2-3 days and have the opportunity to provide feedback throughout the process."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you handle ads/SEO too?",
      answer: "Yes â€” add-ons available after redesign. Once your new website is live and converting, we can optimize your Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and SEO to drive even more qualified traffic to your high-converting site."
    },
    {
      question: "Do you work with all types of Med Spas?",
      answer: "We specialize in aesthetic medicine, including Botox/fillers, laser treatments, CoolSculpting, skin care, and medical weight loss. Our templates and copy are specifically designed for med spa patient psychology."
    },
    {
      question: "What's included in the 14-day redesign?",
      answer: "Complete website redesign, mobile optimization, booking system integration, SEO setup, load speed optimization, contact forms, before/after galleries, service pages, about page, and basic training on how to update content."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my website work on mobile?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Over 70% of med spa bookings happen on mobile devices. Every website we build is mobile-first, meaning it's designed primarily for mobile users and then adapted for desktop."
